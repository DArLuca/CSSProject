How the quest for awards-season glory got so cutthroat.,"Depending on how closely you’ve been following the Oscars race this year, you may or may not know the name Andrea Riseborough. Before Jan. 24, few outside of the film industry did. An actress from northeastern England, Riseborough began her career in​ theater and has worked steadily since. At 41, she has appeared in more than 30 films, including “Birdman,” “Battle of the Sexes” and “The Death of Stalin.” People like to say that the only reason she isn’t famous is that she inhabits roles so completely, she becomes unrecognizable. But on Tuesday, Jan. 24, Riseborough was nominated for a best-actress Oscar alongside Cate Blanchett, Michelle Williams, Ana de Armas and Michelle Yeoh. No one predicted Riseborough’s nomination. She did not appear on pundits’ shortlists. There were no profiles of her in glossy magazines. “To Leslie,” the film about an alcoholic West Texas lottery winner for which she was nominated, had earned just $27,322 at the box office.",The New York Times,,,2023-03-08T10:00:25+0000,article,Magazine,Magazine,News,nyt://article/0077a85c-5fe1-542b-9aff-8712e15e9451,3928,nyt://article/0077a85c-5fe1-542b-9aff-8712e15e9451,MM,36,NA,Inside the ‘Blood Sport’ of Oscars Campaigns,NA,NA,Hidden Figures,NA,NA,NA,By Irina Aleksander,,NA,150928,220,33

The poet left China in the early 1990s, after being imprisoned for nearly a year for leading student demonstrations during the Tiananmen Square protests. He then spent a decade in exile in Paris, Singapore and Argentina before returning to China. In the penultimate stanza of this poem, the imperative appears for the first time, as if the speaker is reminding himself to stay true to himself, despite external pressures to be like everyone else or the “twelve identical bridges,” likely a metaphor for silence. The “traffic” returns in the final stanza, with a slight ray of hope amid loneliness and displacement.

Tallying the costs of Hurricane Ian has just begun. And a report on the strength of the job market is coming this week.,"The new British government’s announcement last week that it planned to make drastic tax cuts sent markets tumbling, the pound sinking and the Bank of England scrambling to restore some calm.

This time: the actor and the ceramist.,"“Design and craft are, for the most part, completely foreign to me,” says the Mexican actor and producer Gael García Bernal, 44. But when he encountered the work of the 39-year-old Mexico City-based ceramist Perla Valtierra, he felt an immediate connection. Combining a traditional Mexican aesthetic and materials with a Japanese-influenced perspective — Valtierra lived and studied in Kyoto and counts the writings of Soetsu Yanagi, the founder of the Mingei folk-art movement, as a prime source of inspiration — her pieces are known for their undulating accents and understated palettes. Improbably delicate loops of ribboned clay trace the edges of vases; graceful, swooping scallops circle the rims of plates and bowls. To García Bernal, the sinuous shapes conjure the spiraling plumes of the steam trains he was fascinated by as a child visiting relatives in northwestern Mexico. “What touches me most is not when I discover something but instead recognize it,” he says. “That’s what happened when I saw her work: I was very eager to meet her.”",The New York Times,,,2023-09-22T09:01:06+0000,article,TStyle,T Magazine,News,nyt://article/01c77dd6-b04e-5d0a-8123-3e0306cb052c,1651,nyt://article/01c77dd6-b04e-5d0a-8123-3e0306cb052c,M2,90,NA,Gael García Bernal and Perla Valtierra on Making Work That Lasts,admiration society,NA,Gael García Bernal and Perla Valtierra,NA,NA,NA,By Elda Cantú,,NA,150930,900,54

I asked Shimoda about the context and composition of this poem, and his answer was a skillful, evocative illumination of the relationship between life and poetry: “I wrote this poem the night after going out on a water drop with a humanitarian-aid group. We drove for many hours through the desert, putting water out for migrants, people trying to stay alive. We met a man who, in the hallucinatory heat of Arizona, asked how far it was to Kentucky. Some important part of an individual exists in the places they are trying to reach, and it is excruciating. It is like we are following the signs and symbols of our future selves through the wilderness. I write poetry when I am feeling haunted by something — an image, encounter — although not as a means of exorcism. I think about what I have seen, heard, experienced, and I go under. I write poetry at night, partly because I believe there is a more humane, trustworthy logic to be found there, although like dreams, and like the landscapes in which they graze, the poems are themselves the interpretation.” Selected by Anne Boyer",The New York Times,,,2023-07-20T09:00:03+0000,article,Magazine,Magazine,News,nyt://article/02c16c96-4e10-5c38-a32b-b6d5f5e449e1,351,nyt://article/02c16c96-4e10-5c38-a32b-b6d5f5e449e1,MM,10,NA,Poem: The Desert,NA,NA,Poem,NA,NA,NA,By Brandon Shimoda and Anne Boyer,,NA,150931,1370,79
